<!--Section 1 - Purpose of Code of Conduct-->
<section id="section-1" class="container">
    <h3>Purpose of Code of Conduct</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants in the Elastic community have the best possible experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets and have a good time!

        The Elastic Community Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the Elastic community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, code repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or public meetings.

        As a worldwide community, diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to, to ensure that the Elastic community continues to be an excellent space in which to communicate, collaborate, and contribute.

        This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended â€” a guide to make it easier to be excellent to each other. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Be considerate - </b>
                Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>

            <li>
                <b>Be nice - </b>
                People often ask me what is the most effective technique for transforming their life. It is a little embarrassing that after years and years of research and experimentation, I have to say that the best answers is, 'just be a little kinder'.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Communicate effectively - </b>
                Effective communication can help to foster a good working relationship with others.

            <li>
                <b>Get for help when unsure - </b>
                Ask help when if you need from us.
